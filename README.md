# Health Risk Prediction and Diet Recommendation System

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project is a **machine learning-based healthcare recommendation system** that predicts an individualâ€™s **health risk category** and provides **personalized diet & lifestyle recommendations**.  
The system uses patient health data (demographics, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, habits, etc.) to classify risk levels (**Low, Moderate, High, Very High**) and suggests actionable steps like **diet plans, exercise, and monitoring**.

The project demonstrates an **end-to-end pipeline**: data preprocessing â†’ model training â†’ evaluation â†’ interactive recommendation system (Flask app).

## âœ¨ Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans data, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, etc.) to uncover patterns in health data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and classification reports.
- **High Accuracy**: Gradient Boosting model achieves ~95% accuracy in predicting risk categories.
- **Personalized Output**:
  - Predicted **risk level**
  - Comparison of patient health metrics vs healthy ranges (charts)
  - **Custom diet & lifestyle recommendations**
- **Interactive Flask App**: Simple UI for users to input their data and get real-time results with visualizations.
